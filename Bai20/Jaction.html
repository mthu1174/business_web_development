                <h3>Jackson Electronics Introduces a New Line of Products</h3>
                <p align="justify">
                    Jackson Electronics announced this month a new line of small business printers, copiers and scanners. Designed to meet the growing need for economical scanning and printing solutions, the new products do not sacrifice quality or dependability.</p>
                <p align="justify"> ScanMaster continues Jackson Electronics' leadership in the field of flatbed scanners. With the patented "Single-Pass" technology, the ScanMaster is fast, with image quality better than multiple-pass scanners.</p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Building on its popular line of laser printers, Jackson Electronics introduces the LaserPrint 5000. The LaserPrint 5000 prints b&w text at 12 ppm. and its memory expands up to 24 megabytes for graphic-intensive print jobs.</p>
                <p align="justify">
                    The new Print/Scan 150 combines the benefits of a printer, copier and scanner - all in one! And all without sacrificing quality. Save money (and space) with this three-in-one product</p>
