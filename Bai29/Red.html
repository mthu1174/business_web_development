        <h2 align="center"> Doc-Centric Sales: Midwest Region</h2>
        <p align="justify">The Midwest region had another strong sales year with record-setting sales of both the M300-25 and M100-11 models. The only disappointment was the lackluster sales of the M300-15 model, which started the year strong but tapered off into the fourth quarter. All-in-all though, a very good year for the Midwest region. </p>
